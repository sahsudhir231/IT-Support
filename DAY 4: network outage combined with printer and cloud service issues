Full Troubleshooting Guide – Day 3 Scenario
________________________________________
Step 0: Gather Information
1.	Ask affected users:
o	When did the problem start?
o	Which services are affected (printer, email, internet)?
o	Are other colleagues affected?
o	Any recent changes on their PC (software, VPN, network settings)?
2.	Document user location (floor, office area) to identify if it’s segment-specific.
3.	Identify device types: Windows PCs, printers, servers, routers, load balancers.
________________________________________
Step 1: Verify Local Connectivity
1.	Check the affected PC:
o	Ping the printer:
o	ping <printer-ip>
	Success → printer reachable locally
o	Ping local server:
o	ping <server-ip>
	Success → LAN connectivity fine
2.	Check printer status locally (power, paper, errors).
________________________________________
Step 2: Verify Internet and Cloud Services
1.	Ping internet addresses:
2.	ping 8.8.8.8
3.	ping <mail-server-ip>
o	Timeouts → WAN/Internet issue
o	Success → cloud/email issue is isolated to server or firewall
4.	Test access to email/web services from another PC.
________________________________________
Step 3: Check Network Devices
1.	Log in to office router/load balancer:
o	Check WAN status
o	Identify if primary WAN is down
o	Check failover configuration
2.	Check managed switches for port errors or traffic congestion.
3.	Confirm DHCP/DNS is operational for LAN clients.
________________________________________
Step 4: Confirm ISP Status
1.	Contact ISP to confirm if there’s a regional outage.
2.	Request estimated downtime if outage exists.
3.	Document ISP feedback.
________________________________________
Step 5: Diagnose Load Balancer / Failover
1.	Check current failover policy:
o	Is secondary WAN configured?
o	Are automatic failover triggers set (link down, high latency, packet loss)?
2.	Test failover manually (if safe) by disconnecting primary WAN:
o	Ensure traffic routes to secondary WAN successfully
3.	Reconfigure or add failover policy if needed:
o	Primary WAN = ISP 1
o	Secondary WAN = ISP 2
o	Triggers: WAN down, high latency, packet loss > 5%
________________________________________
Step 6: Verify Local Printing
1.	Check if printers are networked vs USB:
o	Networked → LAN reachable? Ping printer IP
o	USB → direct connection OK?
2.	Restart print spooler on affected PCs if needed:
3.	net stop spooler
4.	net start spooler
5.	Test printing a local test page.
________________________________________
Step 7: Check User PCs
1.	Verify PC network configuration:
o	Correct IP/subnet
o	Correct gateway
o	DNS settings
2.	Clear cached credentials if users are accessing cloud printers or network shares.
3.	Restart PC if necessary.
________________________________________
Step 8: Communicate with Users
1.	Inform users of the issue and estimated resolution time.
2.	Suggest temporary workarounds:
o	Use local printers
o	Use offline email (if available)
3.	Keep users updated when failover or ISP resolution is complete.
________________________________________
Step 9: Test All Services
1.	Test printing from affected PCs.
2.	Test cloud email access.
3.	Test internet access.
4.	Confirm all services are operational and latency is acceptable.
________________________________________
Step 10: Document Incident and Preventive Measures
1.	Document root cause:
o	ISP outage + load balancer misconfiguration
2.	Document actions taken:
o	Failover policy configuration
o	PC restarts, print spooler checks
o	User communication
3.	Preventive actions:
o	Set network monitoring and alerts for WAN downtime
o	Schedule regular load balancer failover tests
o	Keep ISP contact info for quick verification
4.	Follow up with users to ensure satisfaction.

✅ Best Practices:
•	Always isolate the problem: PC vs LAN vs WAN.
•	Test incrementally: LAN first, WAN second, services third.
•	Document everything, including failed tests.
•	Use redundancy (failover, secondary ISP) to minimize downtime.
•	Communicate clearly with users to manage expectations.

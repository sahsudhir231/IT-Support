## **Step 0: Gather Information**

Before touching anything:

1. Ask the user:

   * “What document are you trying to print?” (file type, size)
   * “When did the issue start?”
   * “Has it ever worked on this PC?”
2. Note the printer model, PC OS version, and connection type (USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet).

---

## **Step 1: Physical & Basic Checks**

1. Confirm **printer is powered on** and no errors are showing on the printer screen (paper jam, low ink).
2. Ensure **printer has paper** and ink/toner.
3. Check **cables or Wi-Fi connection**:

   * USB: check connection
   * Network: check Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable

---

## **Step 2: Check Network Connectivity (if network printer)**

1. Ping the printer IP from the PC:

   ```
   ping <printer-ip>
   ```

   * Successful ping → printer reachable
   * Failed ping → network issue
2. Use tools like **Advanced IP Scanner** to confirm printer is on the network.
3. Restart **network devices** (router/switch) if printer not reachable.

---

## **Step 3: Check Printer Status on Windows**

1. Open **Settings → Devices → Printers & scanners**.
2. Confirm printer appears and check status:

   * “Ready” → ok
   * “Offline” → troubleshoot
   * Errors like “Paper Jam”, “Needs Attention”

---

## **Step 4: Check the Print Queue**

1. Open **print queue** for the printer.
2. Look for stuck jobs.

   * Cancel any stuck jobs.
3. Try printing a **test page** from Windows:

   * `Settings → Devices → Printers → Print a test page`

---

## **Step 5: Restart Print Spooler**

The **print spooler** is often the culprit:

1. Open **Services (services.msc)** → find **Print Spooler** → Restart
2. Or use Command Prompt (Admin):

   ```
   net stop spooler
   net start spooler
   ```

---

## **Step 6: Verify or Reinstall Drivers**

1. Check if the correct **printer driver** is installed:

   * Settings → Devices → Printers → right-click printer → **Properties → Driver**
2. If outdated or corrupt:

   * Go to the manufacturer’s site (HP, Canon, Epson) → download latest driver → reinstall

---

## **Step 7: Check Printer Settings**

1. Ensure the correct printer is **set as default**.
2. Verify printing is not **paused**: right-click printer → **See what’s printing → Resume Printing**
3. Disable **Use Printer Offline** option.

---

## **Step 8: Test from Another Device**

1. Try printing from another PC/laptop on the same network.

   * Works → issue is with original PC
   * Doesn’t work → issue is with printer/network

---

## **Step 9: Check Firewall & Security Software**

1. Sometimes **firewalls or antivirus** block printing.
2. Temporarily disable firewall/security software and test printing.

---

## **Step 10: Advanced Network Troubleshooting**

1. Check router for blocked ports (especially for network printers).
2. Assign a **static IP** to the printer.
3. Ensure **same subnet** for PC and printer.

---

## **Step 11: Firmware Update**

1. Check if the printer firmware is outdated.
2. Update via the manufacturer’s site if available.

---

## **Step 12: Last Resort**

1. Factory reset the printer (check manual).
2. Remove printer from Windows → Add it again.

---

## ✅ **Best Practices**

* Document every step you try.
* Always test after each step (print a test page).
* Communicate with the user: let them know what you’re doing.
* Maintain a backup of drivers and printer settings for quick recovery.
